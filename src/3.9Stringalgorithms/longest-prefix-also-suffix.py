# Efficient Python 3 program 
# to find length of 
# the longest prefix 
# which is also suffix 

# Returns length of the longest prefix 
# which is also suffix and the two do 
# not overlap. This function mainly is 
# copy computeLPSArray() of in below post 
# https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/searching-for-patterns-set-2-kmp-algorithm/

			# the example. AAACAAAA 
			# and i = 7. The idea is 
			# similar to search step.
